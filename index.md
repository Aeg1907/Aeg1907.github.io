## My Favorite CPSC120L Labs

* Lab 6, part 2

    I really enjoyed lab 6 part 2 due to the fact that we got to code an engaging game. Lab 6 part 2 was really educational in terms of coding and in terms of the actual game. The video we watched really helped me learn how to play black jack. I also enjoyed getting into functions in this lab as it is something I needed practice with.


* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was my favorite lab because it was the first of many projects Iâ€™ve done. It was also my first project in college which holds a sentimental value in my heart. Even though it was easy, it paved a way for me and showed me what the rest of the semester would look like. 


* Lab 9 , part 1

    Lab 9 part 1 was also a really enjoyable lab because it was the hardest lab for me. Finding the average using many different types of loops was exhausting. It took me a while to finish it but it was a really enjoyable process that made me a better programmer. I also liked that it had Judges and Jury in it.
